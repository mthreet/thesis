%% DEDICATION
%
%  You have three choices here:
%    1. Use the ``dedication'' environment.
%       Put in the text you want, and everything will be formated for
%       you. You'll get a perfectly respectable dedication page.
%
%
%    2. Use the ``mydedication'' environment.  If you don't like the
%       formatting of option 1, use this environment and format things
%       however you wish.
%
%    3. If you don't want a dedication, it's not required.
%

% \begin{dedication}
%   To two, the loneliest number since the number one.

%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
%
%  While technically optional, you probably have someone to thank.
%  Also, a paragraph acknowledging all coauthors and publishers (if

%
\begin{acknowledgements}
Thank you to my advisor Truong Nguyen for guiding me along the path to my Master's, my wife Kaelyn Threet for encouraging and motivating me while I completed this endeavor, my parents and parents-in-law for providing support to me, and the countless other people who have helped me in reaching this point. Without everyone's contributions I would not have come close to completing this achievement.

\begin{abstract}
	Source Separation (SS) refers to a problem in signal processing where two or more mixed signal sources must be separated into their individual components. While SS is a challenging problem, it may be simplified by making assumptions on the signals that are present and the methods used to mix the signals. One example of this is to limit the range of signals to human voices and to limit the total number of speakers (through either estimation or always having a set number of speakers). This paper assumes that the speech from two speakers is mixed at one microphone, with the voice of one speaker (Speaker 1) being present in all recordings. Traditional approaches to the SS problem typically involve array processing and time-frequency methods to perform the separation. Once such example is Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), which attempts to factor a spectrogram into frequency basis vectors and time weights for each speaker. This paper will explore the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn effective separation of Speaker 1's voice from a variety of other speakers and background noises. The CNN will prove to be much more effective than NMF due to the ability of the CNN to learn a representative feature space of Speaker 1's speech.
